/* A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of units that can be read the same way in either direction. WRite a c-function int palind(int fd1, int fd2) that takes two independent file descriptors fd1 and fd2 that are already opened to the same file. The function palind() uses lseek to scan the file and returns 1 if the file contains a palindrome (reads the same forward and reverse) and 0 if not. You may assume that the file is well-formed and contains just lower-case alphabetic characters on a single line. You also need write a main function to test your palind() function works properly. The main function accepts a file name as an argument. The main() function opens the file once and creates duplicate file descriptors and calls the function palind() to  heck whether the file contains a palindrome or not. */
