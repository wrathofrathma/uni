/* Write c code which passes input (text file) and output file name as a command line arguments. Open the input file as read only and open output file with mode rw-rw-rw. Your program encodes each character to ASCII code number and writes to output file. You need consider argument number error and open file error. You must not use any library function to convert a character to ascii number. */
